# Speed Clamping

## Purpose
Speed clamping ensures that player movement per tick does not exceed the
server-defined maximum, regardless of input direction or magnitude.

This prevents:
- diagonal movement speed boosts
- malicious or invalid client input
- inconsistencies between server and client prediction

---

## Rule

> Input vectors with magnitude greater than 1 are normalized before movement
> is applied.

This means:
- all directions are treated equally
- direction is preserved
- maximum speed is enforced by the server

---

## Implementation

Speed clamping is implemented in:

Game/Simulation/MovementSystem.cs

```csharp

/*var magnitude = MathF.Sqrt(inputX * inputX + inputY * inputY);

if (magnitude > 1f)
{
    inputX /= magnitude;
    inputY /= magnitude;
}
